- 👋 Hi, I’m @pythonprincesss. I like music, getting nostalgiac on Neopets, and bouncing off the walls.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... learning to design simple programs with python, refreshing 15-year-old and fading knowledge of CSS, killing time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... nothing applicable to anything useful, if I'm being honest.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nah.
- 📫 How to reach me ... send any hatemail to persistentpython@protonmail.com
